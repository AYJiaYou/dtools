# dtools
Miscellaneous tools for a programmer's  daily use.  

# Note
All of these tools are come from daily work circumstances which I thought would likely to be encountered in the future. So I keep them down with the DRY rule in mind. They merely fulfill my needs at the specific time and may not mature and suitable for common use cases. Some of them are not even complete or have bugs.  

I'll revise them whenever I need to use them again or have new thoughts on them or bugs found. Any RPs are highly welcomed if you like to share your insights and experiences. :)
